# Utilities
Utilities required for other builds

This repo contains a few minor utility programs that are required to build stuff in other repos,
namely the Tabs and TreeView gadget modules.

rm : A very simple BASIC program that emulates the Unix/Linux rm command

trim : Another simple BASIC program that snips the tail end of Makefiles.
